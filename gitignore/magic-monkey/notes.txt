Node list v array

Node lists are similar to arrays, but don't have as many methods.

document.querySelectorAll() won't return an array, but rather a node list.

You can convert a node list to an array to use array methods on a node list.

arrow function 
    is a shorter way of saying
    elements.map(function(element) {
        return element.length;
    }); // [8, 6, 7, 9]

    elements.map((element) => {
        return element.length;
    }); // [8, 6, 7, 9]

    // When the only statement in an arrow function is `return`, we can remove `return` and remove
    // the surrounding curly brackets
    
        elements.map(element => element.length); // [8, 6, 7, 9]

    data property for HTML data-whatever is a custom property

    the dataset object contains all data attributes that are listed.

    //syntax for css adjustment = style.setProperty(propertyName, value, priority);
    //don't forget that you have to select styleSheets as array elements (or maybe node list?)
